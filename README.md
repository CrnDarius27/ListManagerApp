# ListManagerApp

ListManagerApp is a mobile application designed to simplify the management of product lists by leveraging speech-to-text technology, a local database, and PDF generation. The core functionality allows users to speak a product name in Romanian, store or update it in a local database, and generate (or append to) PDF lists based on the productâ€™s distributor.
